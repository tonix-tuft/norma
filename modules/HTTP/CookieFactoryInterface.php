     * Makes a new cookie object. Starting with PHP 7.3.0, the PHP's `setcookie` function has two signatures:
     * 
     *      bool setcookie ( string $name [, string $value = "" [, int $expires = 0 [, string $path = "" [, string $domain = "" [, bool $secure = FALSE [, bool $httponly = FALSE ]]]]]] )
     *      bool setcookie ( string $name [, string $value = "" [, array $options = [] ]] )
     * 
     * The same MUST go for this method and implementors MUST guarantee compliance with these two signatures.
     * 
     * The `$options` parameter is an associative array which may have any of the keys expires, path, domain, secure, httponly and samesite.
     * The values have the same meaning as described for the parameters with the same name. The value of the samesite element should be either Lax or Strict.
     * If any of the allowed options are not given, their default values are the same as the default values of the explicit parameters.
     * If the samesite element is omitted, no SameSite cookie attribute is set.
     * 
     * @source http://php.net/manual/en/function.setcookie.php
     * 
     * @param string $name The name of the cookie.
     * @param string $value The value of the cookie. This value is stored on the clients computer; do not store sensitive information.
     *                                    Assuming the name is 'cookiename', this value is retrieved through $_COOKIE['cookiename'].
     * @param int $expire The time the cookie expires. This is a Unix timestamp so is in number of seconds since the epoch.
     *                                 In other words, you'll most likely set this with the time() function plus the number of seconds before you want it to expire.
     *                                 Or you might use mktime(). time()+60*60*24*30 will set the cookie to expire in 30 days.
     *                                 If set to 0, or omitted, the cookie will expire at the end of the session (when the browser closes).
     * @param string $path The path on the server in which the cookie will be available on. If set to '/', the cookie will be available within the entire domain.
     *                                   If set to '/foo/', the cookie will only be available within the /foo/ directory and all sub-directories such as /foo/bar/ of domain.
     *                                   The default value is the current directory that the cookie is being set in.
     * @param string $domain The (sub)domain that the cookie is available to. Setting this to a subdomain (such as 'www.example.com')
     *                                        will make the cookie available to that subdomain and all other sub-domains of it (i.e. w2.www.example.com).
     *                                        To make the cookie available to the whole domain (including all subdomains of it), simply set the value to the domain name ('example.com', in this case).
     *                                        Older browsers still implementing the deprecated Â» RFC 2109 may require a leading . to match all subdomains.
     * @param bool $secure Indicates that the cookie should only be transmitted over a secure HTTPS connection from the client. When set to TRUE,
     *                                    the cookie will only be set if a secure connection exists. On the server-side, it's on the programmer to send this kind of cookie only on secure connection
     *                                    (e.g. with respect to $_SERVER["HTTPS"]).
     * @param bool $httponly When TRUE the cookie will be made accessible only through the HTTP protocol. This means that the cookie won't be accessible by scripting languages,
     *                                       such as JavaScript. It has been suggested that this setting can effectively help to reduce identity theft through XSS attacks (although it is not supported by all browsers),
     *                                       but that claim is often disputed. Added in PHP 5.2.0. TRUE or FALSE.
     * @return CookieInterface The cookie.
